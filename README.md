**Creating and maintaining Homebridge plugins consume a lot of time and effort, if you would like to share your appreciation, feel free to "Star" or donate.**

[Click here](https://github.com/SeydX) to review more of my plugins.

## Info

**TadoPlatform** is possibly the biggest homebridge plugin for Tado devices. 


**Multiple home support**

The plugin even offers support for multiple houses. So it is finally possible to create multiple houses and control them together.


**Full HomeKit Support**

Everything Tado offers can be displayed through the plugin in Apple HomeKit. The thermostat buttons themselves have custom characteristics and can even display the air quality for a room. Full hot water support, weather temperature, solar intensity, weather air quality, tado quick actions, child lock, presence lock and much more awaits you with this plugin! 


**History**

Every temperature sensor, humidity sensor, contact sensor, motion sensor and thermostats are also able to show the history in Elgato EVE app. 


**Push Notification**

In addition, you can even get push notifications via Telegram when a user arrives or is absent, or when "Open Window" is triggered.


You can do that and much more with the new version 6. Have Fun!

## Installation

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-tado-platform@latest```

## Custom UI

Unlike other plugins, this plugin allows you to manually enable/disable each zone, thermostat, user and everything you see in HomeKit via config.json.

The config.json offers a lot of configuration options. And if, as recommended, you use Config UI X, the plugin will be all the better.

It supports the full potential of Config UI X and makes configuring the plugin much easier. With it, you can create a "home" in no time and control everything through Config UI X. From logging in to creating config.json works fully automatically with Config UI X!

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tL955Lg/hb-tadoplatform-ui-test.gif" align="center" alt="CustomUI">

_(In the section below you can find more information about the functions.)_
 
## Non Config Ui X User?:

The plugin can also work without config ui x or a custom ui. If you want the config.json auto-fill feature, you have to put the following part in your config.json. This will generate a ready to use config.json with all options disabled except thermostats. After the first start, thhis user will get ``"reconfigure": false``. If you want to refresh a home, just enable ``"reconfigure"`` for the user and restart homebridge. If you want to add an another home, add the user credentials (username/password) to the array. The Plugin can handle multiple accounts. 

**Note:**

If you on HOOBS, you need to reboot the HOOBS server to get your first start config changes instead of restarting Homebridge/HOOBS service.

See [Example Config](https://github.com/SeydX/homebridge-tado-platform/edit/master/example-config.json) for more details

## Configuration

## Thermostat

Each zone in the config.json with ``"type": "HEATING"`` and ``"easyMode": false`` is exposed to HomeKit as a thermostat accessory with the following features:

- Current Mode: OFF | COOLING | HEATING | AUTO
- Target Mode: OFF | HEATING | AUTO
- Curent Temperature
- Target Temperature
- Built-in humidity sensor
- Room Air Quality
- Separate Humidity (if ``"separateHumidity": true``)
- Separate Temperature Sensor (if ``"separateTemperature": true``)
- Battery state (if ``noBattery: false``)
- Delay Switch characteristic with timer (if ``"delaySwitch": true``)
- Elgato EVE history feature (FakeGato)

**Delay Switch**
The Delay Switch (characteristic) can be used for eg. if you have an automation with `Open Window => Thermostat Off / Close Window => Thermostat On` and you want avoid multiple state changes, u can set ``"delaySwitch": true``in your config and change the timer (in seconds) via a third party app. If setted correctly, the thermostat will wait eg 60 seconds before switching to ON. It can also be used for own automations if you need a switch that turns off automatically after the given perioswithout affecting your thermostats (``"autoOffDelay": true``)

**Mode / Mode Timer**
``mode`` for the commands to be sent with. can be 'MANUAL' for manual control until ended by the user, 'AUTO' for manual control until next schedule change in tado° app OR 'TIMER' for manual control until timer ends. ``modeTimer`` for the ``MANUAL`` mode in minutes.

Each zone in the config.json with ``type: HEATING`` and ``easyMode: true`` is exposed to HomeKit as a HeaterCooler accessory with the features as above and some minor changes:

- Active: ON | OFF
- Target Mode: HEATING
- **NO** Elgato EVE history feature (FakeGato)

You can also adjust the minimum temperature step ``"minStep"``, minimum temperature value ``"minValue"`` or maximum temperature value ``"maxValue"`` via config.json. 

- **minValue**: By default, HEATING devices, also this plugin, supports a minValue of 5° Celsius / 41° Fahrenheit. If your device has a different minValue, you can set it up here. (Incorrect minValue may cause problems!)
- **maxValue**: By default, HEATING devices, also this plugin, supports a maxValue of 25° Celsius / 77° Fahrenheit by default. If your device has a different minValue, you can set it up here. (Incorrect maxValue may cause problems!)
- **minStep**: Minimum step for temperature adjustment. (Default: 1, must be between 0 - 1)
